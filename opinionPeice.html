    <p>
       El Paso already has a abnormally high poverty rate for a metropolitan city but due to Tittle 42 ending on March 11, 2023 the border has had a major influx of migrants crossing over<br>
       from South America looking for asylum and because of El Paso's proximity to the border the number of migrants coming into El Paso has overwhelmed local shelters and community fascilitties.<br>
       As a result, many migrants find themselves having to sleep on the streets and resort to panhandling to support themselves. All the more reason to contribute to El Pasoans Fighting Hunger<br>
       and make a difference in our community.
