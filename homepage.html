    <p>
        El Paso has a stagering 20.1% poverty rate and a population of 974,000 people. That means that 195,774 people are financially insecure. That number doesnt take into account<br>
        all the migrants crossing the border every single day. Between October 1, 2022 and December 31, 2022 El Paso sector border patrol reported 162,603 encounters.<br>
        Migrants come to El Paso with nothing, they are people who are looking for a better life for themselves and their famalies. Thankfully there exists organizations like El Pasoans Fighting Hunger<br>
        that provide food to the most vulnerable in our community.
